Continue the [Cu processing walkthrough](/docs/getting-started/first-analysis/)
with a one-shell model. For your own samples, choose appropriate ranges and
constraints; this example does not establish a unique structural interpretation.

## 1. Choose a structure and calculate paths

Open **Fit → Structure → Curated**, select **Cu / Copper**, then
**Use structure →**. In Calculate, select Cu as absorber, the K edge, an 8 Å
radius and **ReFEFF**. Choose **Calculate paths** and wait for completion.

Every 0.2.11 desktop package offers ReFEFF and FEFF10; see the
[Windows ARM64 requirement](/docs/getting-started/install/#arm64-availability).
Record the engine used.

## 2. Select a model

Choose **First shell** in Paths, then **Set up model →**. The Cu example selects
the first Cu–Cu single-scattering path. The calculated reference distance and path
degeneracy describe the reference structure, not fitted results.

Inspect the model's amplitude, energy shift, distance change and disorder
parameters. Their meanings and units are described in
[structures and paths](/docs/desktop/structures/). Keep the initial template for
this example. In **Fit ranges**, inspect $k=2$–12 Å⁻¹ and $R=1$–3 Å. The transform
weight is 2. The fit is in R space; the visible k-space curves can extend beyond
the selected fitting range.

## 3. Run and inspect

Choose **Run fit**. In Results, inspect the measured/model curves, residuals,
parameter uncertainties, correlations where reported, and physical path distances.
A small R-factor and a converged optimizer do not establish that the model is unique
or physically complete.

The screenshot's noise scale is 1. Its uncertainties therefore depend on that
scale and the local covariance approximation; they are not a full experimental
error budget. Read [fitting statistics](/docs/science/fitting-statistics/) before
interpreting the reported standard errors.

Save the project to retain the model/history, and use
[publication exports](/docs/desktop/publication/) to preserve data and methods.
For shared variables across spectra, continue with
[multiple-spectrum fitting](/docs/desktop/multiple-spectra/).


## RMC fitting mode

Version 0.2.10 adds **Fit mode: RMC** at the upper right of Fitting.
Choose a structure, edit its supercell with a live 3D preview, inspect the initial exact ReFEFF
calculation and run coordinate refinement against the processed spectrum.
The initial objective is R real plus imaginary, with R minimum at or above
the saved AUTOBK Rbkg. Adaptive scattering remains experimental and is not
exposed by these controls.

Results update during a run with initial/best curves, coordinates, residual
history and calculation statistics. Pause retains a warm calculator; Stop and
save or an automatic checkpoint supports later resume. **Recover latest run**
loads the most recent durable checkpoint after reopening the application.
Resume uses its original inputs and random-number state. Wait for Pause or
Stop and save to finish before closing if the latest state is needed; an
unexpected exit can lose moves since the previous checkpoint.

The current desktop supports one spectrum and one structure. Hybrid EA and
mixture controls are later additions. Reaching a step limit does not establish
convergence: the display separately reports the shared residual-trend criterion.
Follow the [RMC workflow](/docs/desktop/rmc/) for setup, saved preprocessing,
resume and convergence diagnostics.

The builder updates after a short typing delay without running scattering.
Invalid edits keep the last valid preview and block a new calculation. Suggested
cell size uses the cluster radius and displacement margin; starting fit ranges
respect measured k coverage and begin 0.15 Å above the spectrum's saved Rbkg.
These are editable starting values, not a claim of structural convergence.
