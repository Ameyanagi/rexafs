# Changelog

## 0.2.3

- Deliver the Windows launch, shortcut, selection and accessibility changes
  prepared for 0.2.2, which was withheld after Linux qualification failed.
- Preserve the native accessibility adapter return type on Linux/FreeBSD as
  well as macOS/Windows. Add a native Linux GUI compile check to regular CI.
- Retain linked and embedded 0.2.3 compatibility projects; numerical defaults
  and dependencies are unchanged from 0.2.1.

## 0.2.2 (unpublished)

The immutable tag was retained after the Linux desktop compile check failed.
Version 0.2.3 includes the correction and must pass a new complete release build.

- Open Windows desktop sessions without a console window. Preserve redirected
  diagnostic output and verify the GUI subsystem in the packaged executable.
- Use Ctrl for Windows/Linux command shortcuts and multi-selection, including
  Undo, Open, Save, stage navigation, and clipboard actions. Preserve macOS Cmd
  shortcuts and use each platform's word-navigation keys.
- Reduce accessibility update overhead by sharing the complete activation
  snapshot, comparing nodes by identity, and skipping unchanged native updates.
- Wait for Windows installer diagnostic processes and capture their output.
  Add opt-in graphics-adapter diagnostics and retain native Windows interaction
  checks with measured debug/release timing limits.
- Retain linked and embedded 0.2.2 projects with the existing format-1 state.
  Numerical defaults and solver dependencies are unchanged.

## 0.2.1

- Start in the complete, empty Data workspace and keep Help and theme switching
  accessible. Simplify processing controls, contextual Fit steps, and publication
  previews; synchronize Assistant and structure inputs with the active theme.
- Require explicit main and optional import channels. Add an undoable Remove
  marked action and preview processing operations before applying them.
- Resolve Auto normalization maximum to the spectrum endpoint. Add an optional
  AUTOBK weight link to FFT that preserves the independent value when unlinked.
- Add persistent spectrum color cycles and reversible gradients, plus publication
  presets for XANES, full energy, weighted chi(k), chi(R), and R-space fits.
  Export full CSV arrays alongside 300-DPI figures with Typst labels.
- Add structure center focus and camera-relative depth cues, preserve the bond
  appearance, and reduce structure paint overhead during rotation and zoom.
- Update ruviz and ruviz-gpui to 0.14.1 for consistent font handling, international
  fallback, complete angstrom labels, and PNG strokes without sharp join spikes.
- Add continuous testing for the core plotting feature and retain linked and
  embedded 0.2.1 projects covering weight links, palettes, and publication style.

## 0.2.0

- Unify Groups with durable identities, source/channel stacks, Results, independent
  current/focus/marks, processing locks, and undoable row actions.
- Append imports with per-file receipts and explicit pending-layout review,
  representative selection, partial acceptance, Reload, and Locate.
- Add a focused mapping editor with original table values, full raw μ(E) preview,
  explicit axis conversion, validated channel roles, and unique fluorescence ROIs.
  Apply single or frozen batch repairs as one undoable edit; create only missing
  channels with independent processing settings.
- Persist versioned project/optional machine recipes and exact application members.
  Named compatible layouts import directly; conflicts, changed units, and unnamed
  layouts require review. Saved mappings remain authoritative on reopen.
- Explain known Merge incompatibility before running, retain declared XDI edge
  identities and materialized provenance, and persist historical parser totals
  and bounded line examples with their checked mapping.
- Reuse fixed-penalty column scaling and SVD factors for compatible geometry while
  retaining per-spectrum numerical checks and per-call condition limits.
- Fix Assistant catalog lookup across native Windows path separators; isolate
  FEFF and project-cache roots in storage tests.
- Retain linked and embedded 0.2.0 compatibility fixtures covering Groups, recipes,
  applications, pending sources, declared edges, and saved parser evidence.

## 0.1.4

- Bind tools to the intended spectrum and parameter revision, refuse incompatible
  merges, preserve channel mapping when copying stage settings, and journal
  mapping edits with lock checks and undo. Record result quantities and inputs;
  report parser diagnostics and excluded rows.
- Expose coordination number N for each fitting path and copy fit reports as
  Markdown with parameters, uncertainties and fit statistics.
- Add the experimental Assistant: automatic Codex connection, model/reasoning
  choices, typed transcript with thinking and tool activity, app-authored
  permissions/receipts, web search and structure fetching. Extended access is
  off by default and requires explicit session consent.
- Dock Assistant beside the analysis, resize or pop it out while retaining its
  conversation. Save the newest five conversations per project by default, with
  a configurable limit and saved-thread resume or previous-context fallback.
- Remove the unmaintained derivative macro dependency, pin GitHub Actions to
  commit SHAs, and enable scheduled dependency update PRs.
- Retain linked and embedded 0.1.4 project fixtures covering saved conversations
  and per-path coordination number. Existing format-1 projects remain readable.

## 0.1.3

- Include ReFEFF 0.3.0 and FEFF10 0.2.3 in Mac and Linux builds, retain separate
  calculation sources, and honor cooperative ReFEFF timeouts. Windows uses
  ReFEFF; its MSVC build cannot link the current MinGW FEFF10 prebuilt.
- Verify compiled engines and calculations after archive extraction. Retain
  linked/embedded fixtures and signed, notarized Mac ZIPs and DMG installers.
- Make portable Windows/Linux desktop previews available for platform testing;
  add a per-user Windows setup installer with Unicode-path, payload, shortcut,
  reinstall and uninstall-preservation checks. Native interactive qualification
  for Windows/Linux remains pending.

## 0.1.2

- Use a common χ(k) display weight for comparison overlays and explicitly label
  mixed Fourier weights. Isolate palette input from the underlying plots.
- Expose background k-origin E0, embedded χ standards, advanced solver settings,
  and inverse-transform q range, grid, R weight and independent right taper.
- Correct inverse FFT frequency-bin windowing, full high-R filtering, R weighting,
  resizing and exact q-grid generation in both array backends.
- Add Stable/Nightly release discovery, checksum-verified Mac downloads and machine
  update preferences. Build signed/notarized Nightly apps daily with a separate
  application identity and immutable GitHub prereleases.
- Retain linked and embedded 0.1.2 project samples with new processing controls
  and independent reference-channel identities.

- Import multiple files and folders by appending to the current session; retain
  per-file settings, detect named reference channels, and deduplicate repeated imports.
- Keep sample, fluorescence and reference channels as separate lazy groups with
  independent processing settings, project identities and joint-fit assignments.
  Include all marked additional groups in publication exports with channel provenance.

- Add visible Select all, Deselect all and Invert group controls, with scoped
  keyboard shortcuts and explicit overlay scope.
- Restore per-spectrum project settings across directory aliases and catalog
  refreshes, reload the current plot, and invalidate raw caches when indices change.
- Edit AUTOBK k limits and inverse-transform R limits by dragging plot handles.
  Keep the full measured k range visible while changing the background window.
- Require fit R min to be at least the spectrum's AUTOBK Rbkg, including numeric
  edits, plot drags, restored models, and individual batch/joint solver inputs.
- Expose edge-step overrides, endpoint clamp-point counts and the inverse FFT
  window in the GUI; show when fixed λ is inactive for a legacy clamp model.
- Add flattened normalized μ(E) to Publish as a separate figure using the exact
  library output. Export visible curve data as CSV alongside PNG/SVG figures,
  preserve figure choices across spectrum changes, and flag stale fit figures.

## 0.1.1

- Fix duplicate stationary spectra exposed during fast desktop plot pans by
  upgrading ruviz and ruviz-gpui to 0.13.1. The adapter clears the plot interior
  before compositing the translated preview, including transparent backgrounds.
- Retain linked and embedded 0.1.1 project samples, saved and reopened with the
  current writer; existing format-1 projects preserve their state.
- Use floor when selecting the automatic AUTOBK spline parameter count. For
  rbkg=1 and kmax=12 this selects eight parameters instead of nine. Explicit
  parameter counts remain configurable.
- Use a single linear solve with a configurable [fixed endpoint penalty](doc/autobk-fixed-penalty.md)
  for new AUTOBK analyses (`clamp_lambda = 0.001`, zero disables clamping).
  Match the study's cubic interpolation, floor cutoff, and final endpoint.
  Expose λ in Rust, Python, JavaScript and the desktop inspector. Existing saved
  projects retain their legacy clamp model; new projects persist the new model.
- Update energy/k conversion to CODATA 2022 and share the constants between
  array backends and Athena export.
- Add reproducible [Larch/rexafs benchmark matrices and CPU profiles](doc/benchmarks/2026-09-06-larch/README.md),
  including numerical output comparisons and controlled explanations of AUTOBK
  and Fourier-window differences. Retain a separate [clamp study with known
  synthetic backgrounds](doc/benchmarks/2026-09-07-clamp-study/README.md), direct
  penalty prototypes, profiles and validation of the knot-count change.

## 0.1.0 — release preparation

- Adopt **rexafs** for the Rust crate, Python import, npm package, desktop binary
  and documentation. Preserve xraytsubaki as the development codename.
- Add a shared `Spectrum` workflow across Rust, Python and JavaScript:
  `from_arrays` followed by `normalize()`, `calc_background()` or `fft()`.
  Stages compute missing prerequisites and expose configuration and result getters.
  Validate finite arrays with strictly increasing energy and support an E0 override.
- Add concise Rust `Spectrum`, `Group`, `Error`, `Result` and module entry points.
  Preserve existing advanced APIs and add borrowed `k()` / `chi()` accessors.
- Repair the installed Python module contract, add typed NumPy results and expose
  `rexafs.io.read_qas_transmission`. Remove the unreleased standalone `process`
  facade and legacy Python free pipeline/batch wrappers in favor of `Spectrum`.
- Add browser/Node Wasm packaging and TypeScript declarations, tested from the
  actual npm tarball and in Chromium.
- Upgrade to Rust 1.98.1 and current compatible Rust dependencies; adapt solver,
  ndarray, serialization and PyO3 APIs. Record constrained dependencies separately.
- Read legacy settings when needed, prefer `REXAFS_*`
  variables and retain `XTS_*` fallbacks. Add Windows home/cache handling.
- Fix an ndarray FFT bounds panic for inputs longer than the transform size.
- Remove rusty-fitpack: use local B-splines with a direct QR coefficient solve,
  preserving interpolation boundaries and the existing AUTOBK optimizer.
- Remove GPL desktop tracing dependencies through a documented Apache sum_tree
  patch. Require dependency license checks across all features and platforms.
- Align the FEFF DogLeg parameter tolerance with its numerical Jacobian step to
  prevent near-solution joint fits from stalling at floating-point resolution.
- Add generated rexafs app/release artwork and packaged platform icon resources.
- Keep absorber highlighting in geometric depth order for painting and hit testing.
- Add a publication figure editor with ruviz defaults, size/DPI/label/curve controls,
  PNG/SVG saving and reports with numbered figure/table captions.
- Harden credential settings permissions at creation and repair older Unix files.
- Reject stale FEFF completions after workspace changes and isolate each job’s files.
- Establish `.rxs` as the first release project format, with relative source links
  by default, optional compressed originals and source metadata headers. Remove
  unreleased suffixes. Gate future releases on retained fixture pairs, relocation
  and load/save tests, checked versions, atomic saves and previous-save backups.
- Minimize project JSON without rounding data: omit safe defaults, preserve exact
  floating-point values and validate the reconstructed state before every save.
- Add GitHub multi-platform qualification, portable desktop archives, extracted
  package checks, dependency notices and checksums. Publish from a successful
  GitHub build of the exact version-tag commit and reuse it across channels.

The repository is now [`Ameyanagi/rexafs`](https://github.com/Ameyanagi/rexafs),
with matching package metadata. The `r` stands for Rust and reinventing the wheel.
Publication, platform qualification, distribution license review and domain
deployment are tracked in the [release runbook](doc/releasing.md).
