Download the [room-temperature Cu foil spectrum](/examples/cu_metal_rt.xdi)
from the X-ray Absorption Data Library. It was measured at APS 13-ID-C.
This is a teaching example; use a suitable reference for experimental calibration.
See [data provenance](/licenses/). Select a screenshot for the full application
window.

## 1. Open and verify the data

Choose **Import…** and select `cu_metal_rt.xdi`. In the preview, keep
**Stored signal · mutrans** checked and inspect **Detected energy**. The XDI
header declares energy in eV. Choose **Import 1 spectrum**. This file already
contains absorption: do not apply a second logarithm.

**Open Cu example** in the empty workspace offers a separate bundled 150 K Cu
measurement. The same workflow applies, but its measured arrays and fit results differ.

*Check the Cu edge and column mapping before importing. rexafs 0.2.11, macOS.*

## 2. Inspect normalization

Open **Normalize**. Inspect the estimated $E_0$ and the blue pre-edge and yellow
post-edge fit windows. A blank numeric field means **Auto**; its placeholder shows
the current resolved value. Select **norm** for edge-step-normalized absorption,
or **flat** to remove the fitted post-edge trend from that display.

Start with the defaults. When processing your own sample, choose baseline windows
that exclude the edge structure and remain inside the measured range. Automatic
$E_0$ is an estimate, not an energy calibration.

*The Pre/post toggle displays the baseline fits over the original absorption. rexafs 0.2.11, macOS.*

## 3. Extract EXAFS and transform it

Open **Background**, select **χ(k)** and inspect the oscillations. The recommended
AUTOBK cutoff is $R_\mathrm{bkg}=1$ Å; the background fit uses $k$ weight 1 by default.
A higher cutoff can remove structural signal as well as background.

Open **Transform**, then **k + R**. The default forward window is 2–15 Å⁻¹,
with weight 2 and a Kaiser–Bessel window. Choose a useful upper limit for the
signal-to-noise range of your actual spectrum; this example uses 12 Å⁻¹. The lower plot displays the
magnitude of the Fourier transform. Its peak locations are not phase corrected.

## 4. Save and export

Choose **Save project**. **Link source files** keeps references to your inputs;
**Include source files** makes a portable project with embedded original bytes.
Choose a new `.rxs` filename. See [projects and recovery](/docs/desktop/projects/).

Open **Publish**, choose a figure and PNG or SVG, then **Export…**. Choose
**Analysis folder** as the format to export figures, data, captions, methods and
references together.
Review the figure labels and experimental details before sharing them.

Next, [fit a first coordination shell](/docs/desktop/fitting/) or read
[what each calculation means](/docs/science/processing/).
